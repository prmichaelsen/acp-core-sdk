# ACP Package: core-sdk

Patterns and templates for creating reusable core libraries that can be shared across MCP servers, REST APIs, and client applications

> **This package is designed for use with the [Agent Context Protocol](https://github.com/prmichaelsen/agent-context-protocol). Read more about ACP [here](https://github.com/prmichaelsen/agent-context-protocol).**

## Installation

### Quick Start (Bootstrap New Project)

Install ACP and this package in one command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/prmichaelsen/acp-core-sdk/raw/main/agent/scripts/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

This will:
1. Install ACP if not already installed
2. Install this package
3. Initialize your project with ACP

### Install Package Only (ACP Already Installed)

If you already have ACP installed in your project:

```bash
@acp.package-install https://github.com/prmichaelsen/acp-core-sdk.git
```

Or using the installation script:

```bash
./agent/scripts/acp.package-install.sh https://github.com/prmichaelsen/acp-core-sdk.git
```

### Patterns

#### Service Layer
- **[core-sdk.service-base.md](agent/patterns/core-sdk.service-base.md)** - Base service class pattern with lifecycle management, configuration, and common functionality
- **[core-sdk.service-interface.md](agent/patterns/core-sdk.service-interface.md)** - Service interface pattern for dependency injection and loose coupling
- **[core-sdk.service-container.md](agent/patterns/core-sdk.service-container.md)** - Service container pattern for dependency injection and lifecycle management
- **[core-sdk.service-error-handling.md](agent/patterns/core-sdk.service-error-handling.md)** - Consistent error handling pattern with custom error classes and error codes
- **[core-sdk.service-logging.md](agent/patterns/core-sdk.service-logging.md)** - Structured logging pattern with consistent format across services

### Designs

- **[core-sdk.architecture.md](agent/design/core-sdk.architecture.md)** - Patterns and templates for creating reusable core libraries that can be shared across MCP servers, REST APIs, and client applications

## Why Use This Package

(Add benefits and use cases here)

## Usage

(Add usage examples here)

## Development

### Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Make changes
3. Run `@acp.package-validate` to validate
4. Run `@acp.package-publish` to publish

### Adding New Content

- Use `@acp.pattern-create` to create patterns
- Use `@acp.command-create` to create commands
- Use `@acp.design-create` to create designs

These commands automatically:
- Add namespace prefix to filenames
- Update package.yaml contents section
- Update this README.md

### Testing

Run `@acp.package-validate` to validate your package locally.

### Publishing

Run `@acp.package-publish` to publish updates. This will:
- Validate the package
- Detect version bump from commits
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Create git tag
- Push to remote
- Test installation

## Namespace Convention

All files in this package use the `core-sdk` namespace:
- Commands: `core-sdk.command-name.md`
- Patterns: `core-sdk.pattern-name.md`
- Designs: `core-sdk.design-name.md`

## Dependencies

(List any required packages or project dependencies here)

## Local Development Directories

This package includes local-only directories for development workflow:

### Clarifications (`agent/clarifications/`)

Use this directory to document questions and clarifications during development:
- Create clarification documents using the template: `clarification-{N}-{title}.template.md`
- Document requirements gaps, design questions, and implementation decisions
- **Local by default**: Content files are gitignored, only `.gitkeep` is tracked
- **Optional tracking**: Remove patterns from `.gitignore` to track specific clarifications

### Feedback (`agent/feedback/`)

Use this directory to capture feedback during development:
- Document user feedback, bug reports, and feature requests
- Keep notes about what works and what needs improvement
- **Local by default**: Content files are gitignored, only `.gitkeep` is tracked
- **Optional tracking**: Remove patterns from `.gitignore` to track specific feedback

### Reports (`agent/reports/`)

Session reports and development logs:
- Automatically generated by `@acp.report` command
- **Local by default**: Content files are gitignored, only `.gitkeep` is tracked
- **Optional tracking**: Remove patterns from `.gitignore` to track specific reports

**Note**: These directories follow the same pattern - they exist in the repository structure (via `.gitkeep`), but their content is local-only by default. You can choose to track specific files by removing them from `.gitignore`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please:

1. Follow the existing pattern structure
2. Use entity creation commands (@acp.pattern-create, etc.)
3. Run @acp.package-validate before committing
4. Document your changes in CHANGELOG.md
5. Test installation before submitting
